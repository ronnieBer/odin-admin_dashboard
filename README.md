# PROJECT: ADMIN DASHBOARD

### A Brief Introduction
In this second repository from The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum under the Intermediate HTML and CSS course, I will build an admin dashboard design using CSS Grid for the layout.


### Learning goal
- Know when you might want to use Flexbox over Grid
- Know when you might want to use Grid over Flexbox
- Know when you might want to use the two together


## Reflection/Outcome
As I followed the instruction and completed the basic setup of this Admin Dashboard project in HTML and CSS, I decided to use CSS **Grid** over **Flexbox** for the layout to flex what I learned in CSS Grid.
